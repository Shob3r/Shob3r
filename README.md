# About Me
I am a student somewhat experienced with writing in C#, Java, and XAML. I mainly improve my skills by making custom Unity projects, but have recently started to dabble with Windows App SDK (WinUI3) development too!

## Projects
A few of these will be pinned down below!
### Current
#### [Audio Replacer](https://github.com/lemons-studios/audio-replacer-2)
A helpful tool that will be used in a future mod for one of my favorite video games ever; Persona 4 Golden, in which my one of my friends dubs over every single line of dialogue spoken in the game and in the cutscenes. App written with Windows App SDK
#### [Out Of Body](https://github.com/lemons-studios/out-of-body.git)
My second serious Unity project, much smaller in scope. For a project in my gamedev class 

### Former
#### [Mission: Monkey](https://github.com/lemons-studios/mission-monkey)
This was really my first experience with programming. Was too ambitious and got burned out. Did get me a 100% for the school assignment it was made for though (somehow)
#### [Shob3r's Weather App](https://github.com/Shob3r/Shob3rsWeatherApp)
Simple weather app written with AvaloniaUI. Was my first experience with Windows app development and UI design. It works really well, but the UI is pretty horrendous not gonna lie
