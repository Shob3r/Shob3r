# About Me
I am a student who has been programming for about 3 years. 

I Have Experience in the following programming languages:
- C#
- Java
- TypeScript
- Rust

I also have experience in these frameworks/markup languages:
- [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- [WinUI3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/winui3/)
- HTML

# Projects
These only include projects I haven't abandoned before finishing or projects that I am not proud of. Right now it probably doesn't look like much, but eventually I hope to have a nice list of all the things I have developed

## Current
### [Audio Replacer](https://github.com/lemons-studios/audio-replacer)
A desktop application that aims to help with dubbing over voicelines in video games. This was created for an upcoming project where I get one of my friends to redub the entirety of one of my favorite video games, Persona 4 Golden. Initially, I wrote the app in C# + WinUI3, but due to some weird performance issues as well as massive bloat due to how crap WinUI3 is, I have decided to rewrite the application in tauri (Rust + TypeScript) with Svelte as the JavaScript framework of choice  

## Former
### [Shob3r's Weather App](https://github.com/Shob3r/Shob3rsWeatherApp)
Simple weather app written with AvaloniaUI. Was my first experience with Windows app development and UI design. It works really well, but the UI is pretty horrendous not gonna lie
